# Cosmic Quest
## A Hackmos '24 Original :)

### What is Cosmic Quest?
Cosmic Quest transforms blockchain education into an immersive RPG experience where every learning action is a real blockchain interaction. As players explore different "knowledge realms," they're actually performing cross-chain operations, deploying smart contracts, and building verifiable on-chain credentials. Unlike traditional platforms where you just watch videos, here you earn by doing - deploying actual smart contracts as "spells," using IBC for "realm travel,". Your progress isn't just a score - it's a living portfolio of real blockchain actions, backed by NFTs and verified across chains. It's not just learning about Web3 - it's learning by building Web3

### Directories:
- [corechain](./corechain-v1/) Contains the corechain code for spawning a chain (integrated with rollchains/spawn)
- [contracts](./contracts/) Contains the CosmWasm contracts for Realms, Quests and NFTs **(has unit tests too)**
- [frontend](./frontend/) The frontend website built using Interchain UI Kit with the Genesis Realm
